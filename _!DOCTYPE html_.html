    <h2>Paramore- Brand New Eyes</h2>
    
    <p>
      The album was the bands third studio album. The band formed in the early 2000s with the lead singer
      being Hayley Williams. The band has recently won 2 grammys for their recent studio album This is Why. This is the first time a female led band won 
      the grammy for the best alternative rock album. My favorite song from this album is The Only Exception.

    <h2>Elliott Smith - XO </h2>
    
    <p>Elliott Smith is my favorite singer songwriter. He was born August 6th, 1969 in Omaha,NE. He died October 21, 2003 in Los Angeles,CA from committing suicide. 
      The album is probably the most underrated one of his entire discography. I believe that its the most heartfelt and definitely the best recorded and produced. 
      Though the album isnt as well known as his second produced full length album <em>Either/Or</em> I believe that he is one of those artists that captures vulnerability
      in a natural and sincere way that transcends even his music. My favorite song from this album is I Didn't Understand.

    <h3>The specter speaks</h3>
    
    <p>
      Several more hours had passed, when all of a sudden the specter sat bolt
      upright and exclaimed, "Please have mercy on my soul!"
