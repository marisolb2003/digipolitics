    <h2>Paramore- Brand New Eyes</h2>
    
    <p>
      The album was the bands third studio album. The band formed in the early 2000s with the lead singer
      being Hayley Williams. The album's sound is characterized by energetic guitar riffs, dynamic rhythms, and Williams' passionate vocals,
      creating a blend of alternative rock and pop-punk that resonates with listeners alike. The band has recently won 2 grammys for their recent studio album This is Why. This is the first time a female led band won 
      the grammy for the best alternative rock album. My favorite song from this album is The Only Exception and Looking Up.

    <h2>Elliott Smith - XO </h2>
    
    <p>Elliott Smith is my favorite singer songwriter. He was born August 6th, 1969 in Omaha, NE. He died October 21, 2003 in Los Angeles,CA from committing suicide. 
      The album is probably the most underrated one of his entire discography. I believe that its the most heartfelt and definitely the best recorded and produced. "XO" received critical 
      acclaim upon its release, with praise for Smith's songwriting prowess, vocal delivery, and musical arrangements. Though the album isnt as well known as his second produced full-length album <em>Either/Or</em> 
      I believe that he is one of those artists that captures vulnerability naturally and sincerely that even transcends their music. My favorite song from this album is I Didn't Understand and Question Mark.

    <h3>Cocteau Twins - Heaven or Las Vegas</h3>
    
    <p>
      "Heaven or Las Vegas" is the sixth studio album by the Scottish alternative rock band Cocteau Twins, released in 1990. The album is often regarded as one of their most 
      critically acclaimed works and a quintessential example of dream pop and ethereal wave music. The album features Elizabeth Fraser's distinctive and ethereal vocals, which are 
      accompanied by Robin Guthrie's intricate guitar work and Simon Raymonde's atmospheric bass lines. The combination creates a lush and mesmerizing sonic landscape that immerses listeners 
      in a dreamy listening experience. I feel as though, overall, "Heaven or Las Vegas" is considered a landmark album in the dream pop genre. My favorite song from this album is Frou-Frou Foxes in Midsummer Fires.

    <h4>The Strokes - Is This It?</h4>

    <p>"Is This It" is the debut studio album by the American rock band The Strokes, released in 2001. The album is widely regarded as a seminal work in the indie rock and garage rock revival movements of the early 2000s.
      "Is This It" features a raw and stripped-down sound characterized by catchy guitar riffs, driving rhythms, and Julian Casablancas' distinctive vocals. The album's production is minimalistic yet effective, emphasizing 
      the band's energy and attitude. They released an album during the pandemic which continued to prove the longetivity over the durability of The Strokes as a band as a whole. My favorite songs are Barely Legal and 
      Hard to Explain.

    <h5>The Velvet Underground - The Velvet Underground & Nico</h5>

    <p>"The Velvet Underground & Nico" is the debut album by the American rock band The Velvet Underground, released in 1967. Produced by Andy Warhol, the album is considered a groundbreaking work that pushed the boundaries
       of rock music and influenced generations of musicians. Other than it being a classic, i also feel like the longetivity of the album's relevance goes to show how its impact on genres like punk, alternative rock, and 
       experimental music is undeniable, cementing its legacy as a seminal work of art. My favorite tracks would be Femme Fatale and Ill Be Your Mirror.</p>
